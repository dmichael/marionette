= Marionette -- Realtime audio extensions for Ruby

Marionette[http://marionette.rubyforge.org/] is a set of objects for the Ruby programming language providing facilities for realtime audio synthesis and playback. Marionette is build around Perry R. Cook & Gary P. Scavone's {Synthesis ToolKit in C++ (STK)}[link:http://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk/] .

== Installation

The library is packaged right now as a gem, using the gemspec. When the library is more complete, it will be available through RubyForge. In the meantime, try this:

	$ gem build marionette.gemspec
	$ gem install marionette-0.0.1
	
Beware: there are bugs. Lots of them. And things may not work as expected.

== Basic Usage

In addition to the following example, please have a look at the tests for usage. The tests are not guaranteed to work currently, but that will be fixed shortly.

	require 'rubygems'
  require 'marionette'
	
	# Initialize the audio subsystem and start evaluating DSP graphs (in one step)
	Marionette.start :device => 2, :samplerate => 44100
	
	# Writes audio device details to stdout
	Marionette.probe 
	
	sine = Sine.new :freq => 440
  sine.play
  sleep 10
	sine.stop
